* Headings

hello this is going to be a long line of text. let's see if line wrapping happens, oh good it does.
You can use subheadings like this:

** Subheadings

Any text can go here.
hello my name is alex.
this is a test.
hello again.
I am doing some more testing.
Hello this is org mode.

*** Third level heading

Here is some text under the third level heading.
** Second Subheading

There is some more text here.
And there is more text on this line.
This line of text is for testing purposes.
The same is true of this line.

** Adjusting headings

The position of headings can be adjusted.

- use C with up and down to move a heading.
- use C with left and right to demote/promote a heading.

* Styles

*Bold*
/Italic/
_Underlined_

* Tables 

To create a table use the '|' character.
Press 'TAB' to format the table.
For a boundary row type '|-' and then 'TAB' to format the table.

** Example

Here is a table in org mode.
See instructions above on how to recreate.

* Statuses

** DONE try emacs
   i tries emacs.
   i like to use emacs.
   i used to use vim.
   
** TODO test org mode

This is a helpfull mode in emacs:

1. First of all create a heading.
2. Then use "SHIFT" with an arrow key to adjust the status.

The default action are:

- "SHIFT" left/right to cycle between todo and done.
- "SHIFT" up/down to adjust the urgency (could be A, B, C).
* Dates

You can of course insert dates with emacs.
use C-c . 
C-c brings up a list of org mode features.
Here is an examle: <2021-03-15 Mon>
* General Testing

This section of text is describing this category

** This is a subheading within the test category

This is some text within the first subheading.
*** This is a third level heading
I put This heading in just to check everything was working.

** This is the second subheading

Here Is some test within the second subheading.

Where will this go I wonder?

** Fonts
I am using the roboto font.
It is a variable width font, but it is working fine.
* Source blocks

Emacs org mode gives you the ability to do 'literate' programming.
That is, documenting a program and then including the coded solution within a source block.
* Links

Org mode supports links to other places in the file system.
